# ROTMG sprite maker
A simple **pixel art tool** that mimics the fancy sprite rendering of the peculiar game [Realm of the Mad God](https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/).


You can play with it here: https://rotmgartmaker.netlify.app/

It features an export/import system, using json format for meaningful use in game dev.

Built with Vue.js
